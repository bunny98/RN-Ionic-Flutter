| **Programming language** |  React library and JavaScript  | HTML, CSS, JavaScript and [Cordova Plugin](https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-plugin-ionic)  | [Dart](https://dart.dev/)  |
| **Community Support**  | Strong Community Support with numerous active users helping eachother  | Since it was built on AngularJS almost 7 years ago, its backed by a strong community as well |  Relatively new, so as compared to the other two, has a weaker community support |
| **Performance (from Runtime Perspective)**| React Native lets you build an application that provides native look-and-feel by invoking native APIs and components |    Ionic is different than other frameworks as it uses web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create hybrid cross-platform apps. It needs plugins and third-party packages to wrap your application in native cover so its slower than React Native |  Flutter goes a step ahead because there is no native transition or some bridges to connect with the native environment (Platform-specific SDKs)  |
| **Popularity**  | React Native is more popular than the other two as many tech giants are using it in their production environment including Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Skype, Tesla, Uber, Walmart, Salesforce, Vogue | Ionic is very popular among web and mobile app developers due to its easy learning curve. It is used by MarketWatch, Pacifica, Sworkit, Nationwide, and many more | Flutter has just entered the market but grown in popularity in very less time. It is used by Alibaba, Hamilton Musical, Greentea, Google Ads  | 
| **Supported Platforms** | Android, iOS, UMP | iOS, Android, Web  | Android, iOS, Google Fuchsia  |
| **Open Source** | Yes | Yes, paid too! | Yes |
| **Front-end Support** | Native Components & Declarative UI  | HTML, CSS, wide range of UI Designs | Great support for attractive UIs and built-in Widgets |
| **Code Reusabilty** | learn Once, write everywhere  | One Codebase, any platform(iOS, Android, Web, Windows, Desktop)  | Reusable Widgets  |
|**Documentation**| Up-to-date but imprecise  |   Up-to-date but long drawn | Precise, Clear, up-to-date  |
| **Learning Curve**  | Steep Learning Curve |  Easy Learning Curve due to web technologies like Angular and TypeScript | Moderate Learning Curve |
|**Time-to-Market of App**| Slower as compared to the other two | | Fastest among the three |
|**Code Testing**|  Needs a real mobile device or emulator to test the code | Using any browser, the code can be tested | Needs a real mobile device or emulator to test the code   |
|**Error Reporting**| Really messy! | Compact and readable  | Compact and readable  |
| **Native Performances**  |  Good  | Worst | Best  |
