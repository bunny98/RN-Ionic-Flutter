| **Programming language** |  React library and JavaScript  | HTML, CSS, JavaScript and [Cordova Plugin](https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-plugin-ionic)  | [Dart](https://dart.dev/)  |
| **Community Support**  | Strong Community Support with numerous active users helping eachother  | Since it was built on AngularJS almost 7 years ago, its backed by a strong community as well |  Relatively new, so as compared to the other two, has a weaker community support |
| **Performance (from Runtime Perspective)**| React Native lets you build an application that provides native look-and-feel by invoking native APIs and components |    Ionic is different than other frameworks as it uses web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create hybrid cross-platform apps. It needs plugins and third-party packages to wrap your application in native cover |  Flutter goes a step ahead because there is no native transition or some bridges to connect with the native environment  |
